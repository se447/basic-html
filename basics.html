    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Note that the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>Ordered lists are numbered in a precise order</li>
    </ol>
